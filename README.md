## How to use this repository

Our goal in this tutorial is to help you learn how use gUFO to create your own domain ontology in OWL.

We will start with a plain ontology on the car rental domain and incrementally "gUFOrize" it.

The outcome of each major step in this tutorial is documented in a branch, which you can checkout and open in your ontology editor of choice.
