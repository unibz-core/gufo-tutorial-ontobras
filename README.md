## How to use this repository

Our goal in this tutorial is to help you learn how use gUFO to create your own domain ontology in OWL.

We will start with a plain ontology on the car rental domain and incrementally "gUFOrize" it.

The outcome of each major step in this tutorial is documented in a branch, which you can checkout and open in your ontology editor of choice.

  * `part-0-baseline`: The baseline for this tutorial, a vanila car rental ontology in OWL.
  * `part-1-basics`: A version of the ontology with gUFO, demonstrating how to use the taxonomy of individuals.
  * `part-2-1-qualities`: A version of the ontology demonstrating how to use gUFO's quality patterns.
  * `part-2-2-situations`: A version of the ontology demonstrating how to use gUFO's situations to represent temporary information.
  * `part-2-3-types`: A version of the ontology demonstrating how to use gUFO's taxonomy of types .
